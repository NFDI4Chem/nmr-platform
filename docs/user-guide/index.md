## Core Concepts

### Projects
**Projects** are the top-level organization unit containing related datasets, team members, and settings. Think of projects as research studies or collaborative efforts.

### Datasets
**Datasets** represent individual NMR experiments, containing the raw and processed spectral data, metadata, and analysis results.

### Files
**Files** include the raw instrument data, processed spectra, parameter files, and any associated documentation.

### Metadata
**Metadata** provides context about your experiments including sample information, instrument parameters, and experimental conditions.

### Analysis Results
**Analysis results** include peaks, integrations, multiplet analysis, and any custom processing outputs.

## Workflow Overview

### Typical Workflow

1. **Create Project**: Set up a new research project
2. **Upload Data**: Add NMR datasets with metadata
3. **Process Spectra**: Use built-in analysis tools
4. **Collaborate**: Share with team members
5. **Export Results**: Generate reports and figures
6. **Publish**: Share findings with the community

### Advanced Workflows

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple datasets simultaneously
